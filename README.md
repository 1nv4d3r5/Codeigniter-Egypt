Vunsy system
=====================
Vunsy is a PHP program considered in founding the basic structure of a website, think of vunsy as the Kernel that 
you can use it to make any distribution, likely Vunsy can be used as website kernel, you can build anywebsite using it
just with making your website components, you can use vunsy to assemble it , and it will be your site
vunsy is only a frentend site, so how you can i design my site, you will login using a root and password
then your site will be converted to edit mode, and viola you can add , edit, delete, move your components
add, edit pages, making subpages and subsubpages, endless subgategories
the good news is vunsy is built on the most powerful internet components ( codeigniter, dojo, jquery )
so your site will inherite that features as well,
vunsy is preassempled with a user, sections, package manager applications , and could be extended
applications are a window with menubar that launches outside your site (not connected with the frontend), content,
to give the look an feel of desktop applications, no one can launch applications without your permission
, your site will contain components inside components , any component can be viewed in the page only
or inside the page and subpages, any component can have permissions to determine
who will see it, edit it, delete it, add more components in it.
the desing possibilities are infinite, 
i built that application about 4 times now so it's now the best structure youll ever see
have fun.
