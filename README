Codeigniter-Egypt system
=====================
if you are a website developer then you know the amount of work getting the site components together you  have to make a database base minimal structure and 
1.users table: holding users information
2.pages table: holding pages names and titles, permissions
3.user groups table: users groups
4.content table: site articles and every components



and you need to get your javascript frameworks and some minimal backend pages.
We take about 20% of overall projects work hours in preperations. If you are tired of that then Codeigniter-Egypt is for you.

Codeigniter-Egypt is a very easy CMS that built on a very simple idea like HTML and all the XML languages 
every website is consisting of pages every page may have subpages and so 
every page has a permissions to determine  it's displayable for that user or under any other conditions 
every page contain widgets inside widgets , the widget display data and may have cells that can contain another set of widgets and so on. 
Every widget may have properties and children , the widget is like a function that takes paramters make a process on them and return an HTML result 
Codeigniter-Egypt support the idea of applications on the website every application has a JSON defination file and permissions to use
